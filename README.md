## INTRODUCTION
MataChat will be a sleak, modern, and intuitive messaging platform exclusively targeted towards members of the CSUN Community. As its mission is to further build the school’s sense of community, MataChat will boast the latest Speech-To-Text and Text-To-Speech technologies to help students – especially those with disabilities— focus on what matters most: connecting with friends and staying in the loop.<br><br>
	Unlike past technologies like Canvas Mail, members of our community will be able to instant message one another with a clean, convenient user-interface. It will also feature the aforementioned screen reader technologies to make these social-sharing technologies more accessible and friendly to our fellow matadors with disabilities. <br><br>
	This application, MataChat, will be considered done after the team has delivered a gorgeous and intuitive user interface, basic communication functionalities (like messaging, adding friends, etc.), and of course the accessibility features. MataChat will pride itself on being a messaging application for Matadors by Matadors! And in that regard, by the end of this project, MataChat should be an application that we want to use ourselves.
